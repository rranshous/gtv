Using tvheadend as the video capture backend, provides HTTP API

# pull down the channel list
# pick the last channel
# grab it's stream URL
# open the stream URL w/ omxplayer

omxplayer --live $(curl -v -s -L http://tv:tv@127.0.0.1:9981/playlist | cut -d',' -f2 | grep -v '#' | tail -n 1)


We can use the infoshower project as the image slideshow always on part
when you start omxplayer the video is "above" the images on the display
such that you only see the video while it is playing but when it
is complete you are back to the images


# TODO: setup some sort of warmup script so that when the machine starts
#	it can page through all the channels "warming them up"
# 	it seems that channels can some times fail a few times before
#	attempts to access them succeed
